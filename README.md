I am passionated person on software development, who is studying a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science,<br>
and having a hands-on experience of university/commercial projects! Focusing recently in desktop, app development!! <br>
  ( Per example as opensource software development, retail management system for small to mid-sized businesses ).<br>
  
  
🥰  I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, <br>
as continuing to learn new languages  and development techniques are important to me and the success of the society. <br>
