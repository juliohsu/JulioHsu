🖥️ I am passionated person on software development, who is studying a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, 
and having a hands-on experience of university/commercial projects( such as opensource software development, 
retail management system for small to mid-sized businesses ). <br>
🥰  I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, 
as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and the success of the society. ☺️ ❤️
